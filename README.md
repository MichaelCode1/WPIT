# WPIT
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
The Wave-Particle Interactions Toolset is an open source, Python-based set of tools for modelling the interactions between energetic charged particles and whistler-mode waves in the magnetosphere through test particle simulations. Whereas numerous modelling techniques are described in literature, there is a lack of a unified open-source toolset that incorporates the equations and parameterizations used by different wave-particle interaction models in a user-friendly environment. WPIT incorporates key routines related to wave-particle interactions in a Jupyter Notebook environment, enabling the traceability of all relevant equations in terms of their derivation and key assumptions, together with the programming environment and integrated graphics that enable users to conduct state-of-the-art wave-particle interaction simulations rapidly and efficiently. Specific capabilities of WPIT include: (a) routines for
the calculation of key parameters of the environment, such as plasma densities, frequencies and
geomagnetic field; (b) routines for the calculation of wave properties, such as the refractive index,
wave amplitude and resonance angles, based on the local environmental parameters, according
to cold plasma and fully adiabatic warm plasma theories; (c) models of the interaction of charged
particles with VLF waves under gyro-averaged equations of motion, including routines for the
characterization of the degree of nonlinearity of wave-particle interactions; and (d) a Landau
damping module, which calculates the damping of waves along the ray path due to interactions
with warm particle populations. WPIT can be used either as a stand-alone simulation tool or as
a library of routines that the user can extract and incorporate into an independent simulation.

### The WPIT Repository

The WPIT folder contains the source code builded in the form of modules and sub-modules. WPIT contains four modules, i.e. the *Environment_mod*, the *WaveProperties_mod*, the *LandauDamp_mod* and the *WPI_mod*, which includes three sub-modules, i.e. the *whistler_electron_mod*, the *EMIC_ion_mod* and the *parallel_EMIC_mod*. The *Module_descriptions* folder contains Jupyter notebooks with analytic theoretical description of the equations of each module along with example calls of each routine. The *WPI_tests* folder contains reproduction of results of the literature in Jupyter notebook formats, which act as a verification of the code and as tutorials of the use of WPIT. The *WPIT_Results* folder contains the Jupyter notebooks of the simulations presented in WPIT paper. Lastly, the *Documentation* folder includes the API documentation of the source code in .html format.
